tumblr, one at a time

tumbletime is built on [Reveal.JS](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) by the always brilliant [Hakim El Hattab](http://hakim.se/)

### running it 
To install, 

1. Install the virtual environment:

    cd tumbletime
    ./venv-init.py```

2. Edit run.py so it runs on your host/port of choice. Example: ```app.run(host="127.0.0.1", port=5000, debug = True)
